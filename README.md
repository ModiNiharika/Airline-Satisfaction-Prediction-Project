## Overview

Customer satisfaction is a key competitive factor in the airline industry. This project analyzes a passenger survey dataset to identify what drives satisfaction and builds classification models to predict it from passenger and service-quality data.

**Objectives:**
- Clean and prepare raw airline passenger survey data
- Explore relationships between service factors and satisfaction through statistical testing and visualization
- Train and compare multiple classification algorithms
- Identify the best-performing model and the key drivers of satisfaction

---

## Dataset

- **Records:** 25,976 passenger entries
- **Original features:** 25, including:
  - **Demographics:** `Gender`, `Age`, `Customer Type`
  - **Travel details:** `Type of Travel`, `Class`, `Flight Distance`
  - **Service ratings (0–5 scale):** `Inflight wifi service`, `Online boarding`, `Seat comfort`, `Inflight entertainment`, `On-board service`, `Leg room service`, `Baggage handling`, `Checkin service`, `Inflight service`, `Cleanliness`, `Food and drink`, `Ease of Online booking`, `Gate location`, `Departure/Arrival time convenient`
  - **Delay data:** `Departure Delay in Minutes`, `Arrival Delay in Minutes`
  - **Target:** `Satisfaction` (satisfied / neutral or dissatisfied)

- **Note:** `Record_id` and `id` are identifier columns present in the raw data. They are retained in the preprocessing CSV for traceability but are explicitly excluded from the model's feature set.

> The dataset CSV files are not included in this repository. See [Getting Started](#getting-started) for setup instructions.

## Project Workflow

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Data Preprocessing</strong> — <a href="Preprocessing.ipynb">Preprocessing.ipynb</a></summary>
<br>

- Loaded and inspected the dataset; renamed unlabelled columns and corrected row indices
- Called `df.info()` to confirm data types across all 25 columns
- Identified and imputed 83 missing values in `Arrival Delay in Minutes` using **median imputation**
- Converted target column (`Satisfaction`) to binary (1 = satisfied, 0 = neutral/dissatisfied)
- Printed duplicate-row count before and after `drop_duplicates()` for full transparency
- Binned `Age` into five labelled groups: Teen (0–18), Young (18–30), Mid (30–45), Senior (45–60), Old (60+)
- Computed descriptive statistics for all numeric features
- Ran a one-way **ANOVA test** on `Class` vs. `Satisfaction` (F = 4276.58, p < 0.001) — confirming travel class has a statistically significant effect
- Computed feature correlations against the target variable
- Exported cleaned data to `data/data_preprocessing.csv`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Exploratory Data Analysis</strong> — <a href="Data_Visualization.ipynb">Data_Visualization.ipynb</a></summary>
<br>

- **Univariate analysis:** satisfaction distribution, age distribution, flight distance distribution, class distribution
- **Bivariate analysis:** class vs. satisfaction, inflight wifi vs. satisfaction, seat comfort & inflight entertainment vs. satisfaction, online boarding/food & drink/cleanliness/inflight services vs. satisfaction
- **Multivariate analysis:** correlation heatmap across all numeric features

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. Modeling</strong> — <a href="ML_Model.ipynb">ML_Model.ipynb</a></summary>
<br>

- Dropped non-predictive identifier columns (`Record_id`, `id`) before the feature/target split
- Applied one-hot encoding (`pd.get_dummies`, `drop_first=True`) to categorical variables
- 80/20 train-test split (`random_state=42`)
- Applied `StandardScaler` fitted on training data only (no leakage); same scaler applied consistently to test data and new-customer inference
- Trained and evaluated six classification algorithms using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Tested the best model on a sample new-customer input, passing it through the same scaler transform used during training

## Key Findings

- Business class passengers show notably higher satisfaction than Economy and Economy Plus passengers
- Most passengers fall in the 30–45 age range and take short-distance flights, where service quality and delays have an outsized impact on satisfaction
- Top correlates of satisfaction: **Online boarding** (0.49), **Inflight entertainment** (0.40), **Seat comfort** (0.35)
- No single feature dominates (no correlation ≥ 0.7) — satisfaction is a combination of factors, with **online boarding** standing out as the most consistent differentiator between satisfied and dissatisfied passengers
- ANOVA confirms travel class has a statistically significant effect on satisfaction (F = 4276.58, p < 0.001)

## Model Performance

> These results reflect the notebook's last full run. Re-run all three notebooks locally after setting up your `data/` folder to generate fresh outputs.

| Model | Accuracy |
|---|---|
| Naive Bayes | 83.14% |
| Logistic Regression | 86.78% |
| K-Nearest Neighbors (k=5) | 90.55% |
| Decision Tree | 92.76% |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | 93.88% |
| **Random Forest** | **~95%** |

**Best model — Random Forest Classifier**, with precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.95 (weighted average) and balanced performance across both satisfied and dissatisfied classes.

The final model was also tested on a sample new-customer input, passed through the same `StandardScaler` used during training to ensure a consistent feature space.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd AirlineProject
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Create a `data/` folder at the project root and place your copy of `test.csv` inside it
4. Run the notebooks in order:
   ```
   Preprocessing.ipynb → Data_Visualization.ipynb → ML_Model.ipynb
   ```

## Documentation

A full project report — including background, objectives, methodology flowcharts, and detailed model outputs — is available in [`documentation.pdf`](documentation.pdf).

---

## Limitations & Future Work

- Stored notebook outputs reflect the last full run; re-run all notebooks after setting up the `data/` folder to regenerate verified results
- No hyperparameter tuning or cross-validation was performed — all models use default scikit-learn parameters
- No saved model artifact or standalone inference script is currently included
- Potential next steps: `sklearn.Pipeline` for end-to-end preprocessing, `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning, SHAP values for feature-importance explainability, and a lightweight deployment demo (e.g. Streamlit)
